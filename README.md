# Pytest

A basic pytest project

## Getting started

Before setting up the environment, make sure you have python 3.10 available. You can check which version of python you've got by running:

```shell
python --version
```

If the output is anything other than `Python 3.10.[X]`, follow the steps below for setting up python with pyenv. Otherwise, carry on:

```shell
python -m venv .venv                # create virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate           # activate virtual environment
pip install -r ./requirements.txt   # install packages
```
